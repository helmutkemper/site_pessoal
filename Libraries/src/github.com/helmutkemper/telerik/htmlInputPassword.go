// <input> elements of type "password" provide a way for the user to securely enter a password. The element is presented
// as a one-line plain text editor control in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, usually by replacing
// each character with a symbol such as the asterisk ("*") or a dot ("â€¢"). This character will vary depending on the
// user agent and OS.
//
// Specifics of how the entry process works may vary from browser to browser; mobile devices, for example, often display
// the typed character for a moment before obscuring it, to allow the user to be sure they pressed the key they meant to
// press; this is helpful given the small size of keys and the ease with which the wrong one can be pressed, especially
// on virtual keyboards.
//
// Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords (e.g. login forms) should be served over HTTPS; Many
// browsers now implement mechanisms to warn against insecure login forms; see Insecure passwords.
